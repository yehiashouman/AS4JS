This project is an opensource library, an implementation of the native Actionscript classes in Flash Player, that allows Actionscript developers to leverage their existing knowledge of Actionscript using Javascript. 

In simple words, you can create a .js file and write actionscript in that to run on the browser (without Flash Player). 

The project is still at its early stages, If you would like to contribute please write me.


Known limitations:
1. No datatyping (As is the case with Javascript)
2. .... TBD
3. Importing a class in Actionscript works here like how you include a jscript file. You do it in your main html file.
